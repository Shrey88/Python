"""
    Python class don't need getters and setters to allow you to read and change the values
    of their attributes or instance variables.
    Please refer the oops_game program to understand the usage of getter and setter.

    It doesn't have the facility to make class attributes private
    python does not enforce the idea of private variables.

    you are free to change anything you want but if the creator of the class has hidden that data attribute by prefixing
    its' name with an underscore, then you may cause problems id you go and change the value of it.
