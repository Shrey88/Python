we need to add new url for index path

create a url object with two parameters
    first one:  is the path that we want to match i.e. #localhost/index

    second one: is the view function, url(r'^index/', views.index)

Function Parameters:
    first parameter :   r means the string is raw
                        ^ carat means the start of the string

    second parameter :  it access the index function from the view's file
                        and to access that we need to import the module Treasuregram
                        if this pattern (views.index) is matched then the request will sent to the view
                        go inside the Treasuregram app, inside that look for view.py file and then
                        call the index view function, which will send it to index view function that we wrote.


Now if the user visits localhost/index, they will be sent to Treasuregram app's index view
which will return http response

URL Dispatcher best practices :
    localhost/index goes to out homepage, but this is kind of ugly url

In Django the best practice is to have a project URL dispatcher and an app URL dispatcher.
right now project URL dispatcher is handling all the requests.
we would like to funnel request for our Treasuregram app to our Treasuregram app URL dispatcher,
so we need to create a new urls.py file in the Treasuregram folder
