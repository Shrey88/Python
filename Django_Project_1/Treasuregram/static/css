Like templates Django automatically looks for static files in directory name static in your app

static directory is for storing the static files like CSS, Javascript and static images

we can also add CSS framework like Bootstrap to do some style work

we will make sure that minifield bootstrap file is in our static folder and then we will link to template just like
we did the style.css file
