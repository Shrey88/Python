In the template, we can access a variable from the context by surrounding it with {{}}, which is the part
of the Django template language.

we can access the values in the context by their keys in the template.

during the rendering, all of the {{variables}} are replaced with their values, which are looked up in the context.

how do we display the HTML for each object in the treasures list?
{% for treasure in treasures %}
        <p>{{ treasure.name }}</p>
        <p>{{ treasure.value }}</p>
{% endfor %}
we can create a for loop similar to Python code using tags
the endfor tag tells Django where the for block ends.

how to add the if condition?
{% if treasure.value > 0 %}
    {{ treasure.value }}</p>
{% else %}
    Unknown</p>
{% endif %}


in template file we need to add {% load staticfiles %} to make the static files available to the template
we need to link our stylesheet
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'style.css' %}" />
this tells django to load the style.css file from the static folder.
