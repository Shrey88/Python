how to perform the migration?

we need to run two commands in the console
1. python manage.py makemigrations : makes a migration file

before running the migrate command we can preview what the sql command will be executed
python manage.py sqlmigrate Treasuregram 0001

then to apply the migration to database we run
2. python manage.py migrate : applies the migration to database

Now we are done with the migration we can create our Treasure model to Treasure objects and to do this we will use
Django interactive shell

we need to import our treasure model from the Treasure app models

from Treasuregram.models import Treasure

then we will type
Treasure.objects.all() --> we get an empty list since we haven't created any treasure objects yet

Treasure.objects.all is like a django query set. A query set is like a select statement in sql
all the query sets start with the modelname.objects so that's like select statement in SQL

Retrieving all objects in SQL it is like SELECT * FROM Treasure

but in Django, it will be like Treasure.objects.all()

if you want the where clause then you need to use filter in django
Treasure.objects.filter(condition)

Create a treasure object
t = Treasure(name = 'Gold Nugget', value = 500.00, material = 'gold', location ="Curly's Creek, NM")

Save Treasure object
t.save()

now we need to update our view to pull this data from our database and then pass it to the template for rendering
