the context dictionary worked for simply sending two values

but what if we have complex data like name, value, nmaterial, location associated with treasure
or bunch of treasures, how would we send it to template in a context

we can use the class to store the information about the Treasure object and then use the list to store all of
the treasure objects and we can name it treasures and then we have only one variable to put it in context
