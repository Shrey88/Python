Pandas and Openpyxl are powerful tools in their own right, they both have their own short comings.
However they support integration with each other. When you use them both together, they help cover for the other's
weaknesses.

Openpyxl is great for all kinds of visualisation and basic Excel work.
But when it comes to large datasets, its fairly slow.

Pandas doesn't have to deal with the visualization and working directly with Excel as much, it can take on extremely
large datasets and perform analysis extremely fast.
