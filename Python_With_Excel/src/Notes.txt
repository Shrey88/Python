Pandas: python library used primarily for data science to examine, sort or modify data

        it essentially creates a spreadsheet for us in our python code called the dataframe.

        this dataframe has indexed rows and header columns that both store are called series.

        the series stores all the values in the rows and columns almost like list, because both these obj are
        iterable pandas make it easy to traverse and pick up data


Dataframe:  we can do any kind of analysis or grouping

            can be exported to Excel


In pandas you can create dataframes or other objects in code, since we are using python with excel.
we are only going  to look at how to create dataframes to read the files that already exist.

Pandas Documentation:   pandas can read multiple types of files, this is because the data is structured in any way and you'll be able to interpret it

                        we need to specify the dataframe type for the type of file we are going to read

openpyxl:   if you are frequently reviewing your spreadsheets or copying and pasting to new Excel documents or working
            to make data look good then openpyxl is the package in python that allows our code to interact directly with
            Excel documents.
            With openpyxl, we gain the freedom to manipulate not just the data in the spreadsheet, but the properties
            of the spreadsheet itself. it does this by storing an Excel workbook as well as the worksheets as objects
            that we can alter with our code.
            Openpyxl is the most used module for dealing specifically with Excel, as it allows us to do anything from
            styling sheets to parsing data or creating graphs.
